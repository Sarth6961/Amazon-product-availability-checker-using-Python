# Amazon-product-availability-checker-using-Python
As we know Python is a multi-purpose language and widely used for scripting. Its usage is not just limited to solve complex calculations but also to automate daily life task. Letâ€™s say we want to track any Amazon product availability and grab the deal when the product availability changes and inform the user of availability through email. It will be a great fun to write a Python script for this.
Note: Install the required libraries (as per the code) before running the script. Also, note if the product is not available currently then no email will be sent to user. Asin Id should be provided by the user for the product he wants to keep track of.
